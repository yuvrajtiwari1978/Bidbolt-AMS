# Complete GitHub Setup Guide - Auction Management System

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Need to Do (I Cannot Do This Part)

Since I cannot directly access GitHub or authenticate with your account, you'll need to complete these final steps:

### Step 1: Create the Repository
1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository Name**: `auction-management-system`
3. **Description**: "Full-stack auction management system with React frontend and Node.js backend"
4. **Visibility**: Select **Public**
5. **Important**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Get Your Repository URL
After creating the repository, you'll see a page with commands. Copy the HTTPS URL, it will look like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auction-management-system.git
```

### Step 3: Update the Remote Origin
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

<execute_command>
<command>git remote remove origin</command>
</execute_command>

Now I'll wait for you to provide your actual GitHub username so I can set the correct remote:
